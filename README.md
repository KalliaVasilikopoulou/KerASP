This program creates:

 - a dataset specifically for the training of the neurasp model and saves it in the train_data folder
 - a default neurasp model, trains it and saves it in the solver folder (it also saves the classifier of the neurasp model in a separate classifier folder)
 - tokenizes for the dataset, if the user needs them, and saves them in the train_data folder
